/*
* 'ps' is referred as array of pointers.
* There are two pointers in 'ps', since there are two string literals as initializers.
* Followings are the interpretation of various expressions:
* Just 'ps' returns base address of entire array.
* 'ps[i]' returns base address of ith string.
* '*ps[i]' returns first character of ith string
* There is special treatement given by cout to char * or const char *.
* It prints entire string and not the content of the pointer which is address.
* To print content of the pointer char * or const char * will have to be typecasted to 'void *' or 'const void *'.
