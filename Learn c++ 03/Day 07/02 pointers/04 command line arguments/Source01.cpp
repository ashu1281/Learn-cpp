- Note argc and argv are not keywords.
- argc and argv can be replaced by any other name.
- Command line arguments can be inputted from Visual Studio.
  Click Project > Properties > Debugging > Specify arguments in "Command Line Arguments" property.
- Note program always receive command line arguments as strings
  i.e. an integer, a real number, boolean value, date or any other
  value is received as string.
  Hence to process such argument type conversion is required from
  string to corresponding type.
- First argument is always full name of the executable.
