/*
- 'Draw' of 'Shape' is known as pure virtual function or abstract function.
- When we know certain operation exist in the base class but we don't know its
  implementation, then we declare such function as a pure virtual function or abstract function.
- Having one or more abstract functions in a class, makes that class an abstract class.
- Note 'Shape' class is now an abstract class.
- An abstract class cannot be instatiated.
- The class which can be instatiated is called as concrete class. For ex. 'Triangle', 'Rectangle' classes
  are concrete classes.
- If abstract function of a base class is not implemented in derived class then that derived class also
  becomes an abstract class. Oval is an example of derived class turned into abstract class.
- Pointer and reference of an abstract class can be defined.
- Abstract class besides abstract methods can have all sorts of members.
