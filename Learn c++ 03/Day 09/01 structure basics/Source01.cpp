/*
- The structure 'Point' is called as user defined type (UDT).
- The 'x' and 'y' are called as data members.
- Preferrably struct is declared globally, so that it is available to
  all functions of that translation unit.
- Typically structs are declared in header file. And header file is included
  at the top of the .cpp file.
- When variables in an assignment are of same udt then the assignment can be done
  directly between them.
- When variables in an assignment are of different udts then the assignment is to be done
  member-wise.
- Use '.' operator while accessing members using variable/reference.
- Use '->' operator while accessing members using pointer.
