- Above program results into dangling reference 'h' in main.

/*
Above program is a bad program because it is trying to return a
reference of a local non-static variable, which is released as
soon as control exits the function. This makes returned reference
dangling reference.

////Remember, the lifetime of a reference should never be greater than
	lifetime of a referent.
