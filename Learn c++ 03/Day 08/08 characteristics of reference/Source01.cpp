/*
- Initialization of reference is compulsory.
- It's not like pointer.
- A pointer can be defined without specificing the address where it is
  supposed to point.
- Address can be assinged to pointer later on.
- A reference cannot be assigned referent later on.
- It has to be specified at the time of its definition.
