- In above program 'j' is known as reference and 'i' is known as referent.
- The relationship between reference and referent remains in existance till reference exists.

  ////It cannot be broken in between. Once reference is released, the relation comes to an end.

- Since 'i' is scalar , 'j' is referred as reference to scalar.
