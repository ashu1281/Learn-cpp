void main() {

/*
* The type of 5 is int and the type of u is double, hence type conversion is involved in the above progam.
* It's a implicit kind of type conversion since there is no loss of data while converting from int to double.
* Following convrsions happen automatically
* bool -> char -> short int -> int -> unsigned int -> long -> unsigned -> long long -> float -> double -> long double
