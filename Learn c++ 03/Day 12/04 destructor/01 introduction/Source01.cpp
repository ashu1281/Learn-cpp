- Destructor is a special member function, which is called automatically
  before object is about to be released.
- Remember constructor never allocates object space and
  destructor never releases object space.
- Destructor always exist in class.
- If we omit writing destructor then compiler supplies the destructor.
- Compiler supplied destructor doesn't do anything.
