/*
* A main function can return a value.
* Return type of main can be void or int.
* Value returned from main is received by operation system.
* This value is called as exit code.
* Common convention is that if application ends with exit code 0 it means application was terminated normally.
* If it ends with exit code other than 0 then one has to refer documentation of application.
* On console, can be used to retrieve the exit code reported by the application.
* Writing return statement in main is optional. In such case, main returns 0 as an exit code.
