/*
- By default, when mode is not mentioned, ofstream object opens file
  in ios::out mode. "Note ios::out is a overwrite mode. All the data present in the
  file is lost and there is no way to get it back."
- The ofstream object mode can be one of following: ios::out, ios::app and
  ios::ate. ios::out and ios::ate opens file in overwrite mode, while ios::app
  opens file in append mode.
- In append mode, previous contents are preserved, and new contents get appended to\
  the file.
- ! operator has been overloaded in both ofstream and ifstream classes.
  When used alongwith object of ofstream, it tells us if the file was opened
  successfully or was it a failure.
