A file can be classified either as text or binary file.

Files such as source code files, txt files are text files.

Files such as music files, movie files, images, objs, exes are binary files.

When file is opened in text mode, character code 26 has special meaning.
It indicates EOF (End of File). Also a sequence of character codes 13 (CR) and 10 (LF) 
is read as a single character.

This is not so when file is opened in binary mode i.e. character with character code
26 is not treated as EOF character and sequence of character 13 and 10 is not
read as single character.
