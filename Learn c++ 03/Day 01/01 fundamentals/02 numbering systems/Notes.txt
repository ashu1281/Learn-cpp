- Hexadecimal (occasionally used)
- Octal (less frequently used)
- Binary (less frequently used)

List the symbols that make up Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal Numbering Systems.

Which is the numbering system used in computer systems?
- Binary

How is number such as 239 represented in binary?
- Using place value technique.

How is character such as 'A' is represented in binary?
- Using character code.
- A character code is a binary code assigned to a character.

What is a character set?
- A character Set is a list of characters recognized by the computer.

What are ASCII, ANSI, UNICODE?
- These are standard character sets known and followed across the world.

What is bit?
- Bit is a shortform of BInary digiT.
- The digits of binary numbering system such as 0 and 1 are known as binary digits.
- 0 of binary numbering system is known as binary digit, so as 1 of binary numbering system.

What is nibble?
- A group of 4 bits is known as nibble.

What is byte?
- A group of 8 bits is known as byte.

What is word?
- There is no definitive answer.
- In common usage, a "processor word" refers to the size of a processor register.
  In simple cases, a 32 bit processor will have a 32 bit "word" size. A 64 bit processor
  will have a 64 bit "word" size.
- In Intel docs, a "Word" is 16 bits.
  A "Doubleword" is 32 bits.
  A "Quadword" is 64 bits. 

What are KB, MB, GB?
- They are the units used to measure size of memory/files/external storage etc.

  KB stands for Kilo Bytes
  MB stands for Mega Bytes
  GB stands for Giga Bytes
  TB stands for Tera Bytes
  PB stands for Peta Bytes
  EB stands for Exa Bytes
  ZB stands for Zeta Bytes
  YB stands for Yotta Bytes

  1024 bytes = 1 KB
  1024 KBs = 1 MB
  1024 MBs = 1 GB
  1024 GBs = 1 TB
  1024 TBs = 1 PB
  1024 PBs = 1 EB
  1024 EBs = 1 ZB
  1024 ZBs = 1 YB
