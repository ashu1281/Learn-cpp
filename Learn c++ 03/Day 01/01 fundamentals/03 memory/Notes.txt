What are KB, MB, GB?
- They are the units used to measure the size of memory.
- They are also used to measure size of files and external storage.

  KB stands for Kilo Bytes
  MB stands for Mega Bytes
  GB stands for Giga Bytes
  TB stands for Tera Bytes
  PB stands for Peta Bytes
  EB stands for Exa Bytes
  ZB stands for Zeta Bytes
  YB stands for Yotta Bytes

  1024 bytes = 1 KB
  1024 KBs = 1 MB
  1024 MBs = 1 GB
  1024 GBs = 1 TB
  1024 TBs = 1 PB
  1024 PBs = 1 EB
  1024 EBs = 1 ZB
  1024 ZBs = 1 YB
