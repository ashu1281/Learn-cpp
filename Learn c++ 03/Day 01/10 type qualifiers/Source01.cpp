/*
* By default int is signed.
* signed and unsigned are mutually exclusive hence we can use only one of them at a time.
* Similarly, long and short are also mutually exclusive hence we can use only one of them at a time.
* When signed, unsigned, long, short is used, then mentioning of int is optional.
  If int is not mentioned, variable is assumed to be int.
* All type modifiers (signed, unsigned, long, short) can be applied to int.
* Size of int and long int is 4 bytes. So there is no difference between int and long int in case msvc++.
* Size of short int is 2 bytes in case of msvc++.
