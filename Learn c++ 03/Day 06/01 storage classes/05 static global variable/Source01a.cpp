/*
- The lifetime of a static global variable is application wide.
- The scope however is translation unit wide in which it is defined.
- The location is global/static space.
- If multiple source files define static global variable with same
  name then it is perfectly valid. In that case each translation unit
  will have its own copy of respective global variable.
////- Preprocessed source file is called as translation unit.
