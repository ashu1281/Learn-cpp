/*
- While working with global variable, we define global variable
  in one implementation file (.cpp) and declare in header file.
  And we include that header in other implementation files as needed.
- The declaration of a global variable is done with the help of 'extern' keyword.
- Note only global variable can be declared i.e. local variable cannot be declared,
  it can only be defined.
- What is the difference between declaration and defintion?
  When a symbol is defined, memory resource is consumed.
  When a symbol is declared, no memory resource is consumed.
