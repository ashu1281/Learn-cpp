/*
- Constructor is not called for pointer and reference.
- Since constructor is not called, the destructor is also not called
  for pointer and reference.

- Why constructor is not called for pointer?
  Remember, pointer is not an object. It points to an object.
  Hence since its not an object in itself, constructor is not called.

- Why constructor is not called for reference?
  Reference refers to referent. Since referent is already constructed there is
  no need to call constructor for the reference.
