/*
- Specification of 'this' pointer within member function is optional.
  Hence it is eliminated in above code.
- The 'this' is a keyword in c++ language.
- The 'this' pointer exist only in non-static member function and not in global functions.
- It is set automatically by the program based upon which object is used to call the member function.
- C++ implements 'this' pointer as constant pointer.
- Logically speaking, 'this' can be thought as first parameter of member function.
  Note it is not a member of struct/class/object space.
- Physically, 'this' is passed via register.
- The type of 'this' pointer is same as that of the struct/class type.
